                        and what does it entail?</span>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Feedback from your customers and employees (your internal customers), is important
                            for you to know how you are performing. Asking for feedback invites all customers to
                            share their opinion, because sometimes if not requested, people keep quiet so as not to
                            offend. It is important to also request feedback before the customer leaves negative
                            feedback online or tells friends.</p>
                        <p>Our solutions offer various customized options and we also offer in our market research

                            the needs of potential customers, allowing you to rectify issues that arise quickly, before

                        <p>Our boosters are designed to cater to the different points in ensuring your customers get
                            the utmost satisfaction in their order process, and they are broken down to reflect the
                            different points. Your business might have hacked some of these points and that means
                            you are already among the few on the path to excellent service delivery. If that is the
                            case, well done but it isn&#39;t complete until you ensure that the end to end customer
                            experience is hassle free for your customers. You can then purchase the ones that apply

                        <p>The design and creation of your products are all on you as a business. You are to ensure

                            durability, functionality etc. Our boosters ensure that the entire customer experience
                            from start to finish is a positively memorable one for them. Your product can be
                            consumed and forgotten immediately after, but the way you make your customers feel
                            stays with them and can be the deciding factor in whether or not another purchase or
                            referral is made.</p>
