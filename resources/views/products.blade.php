					<p>Our boosters are a great way to introduce structure to your business, because once you have them, 
						team members simply need to follow the established guidelines. We have four great boosters that 
						can transform your customers’ experiences. They eliminate guesswork in your processes and so ensure 
						that your team knows exactly what to do at any given time and that all customers have a consistent 
						pleasant experience. They are easy to use, so you can delegate comfortably and leave these tasks to 
						the staff responsible and have more time for you to focus on tweaking and refining the actual products 
						for your business growth. It also means your team is a lot more efficient and effective in achieving 
						your business goals.</p>
					<p>Are you working solo or as a freelancer? Great but your customers do not need to know that! Our 
						boosters can work for you too - they give you the confidence to provide consistent service and 
						address any queries or issues - and by so doing, set a great standard for your business.</p>

						<h5 class="text-dark mb-3 text-uppercase">First Impression Matters</h5>
						<p>There is no time to make a good second impression, so it is important to make a great first impression 
							with potential customers, whatever the medium used to get in touch with you.  This includes WhatsApp, 
							telephone calls, social media, and emails. 
							This step is not to be taken lightly; many businesses lose potential customers at this stage. 
							This booster ensures that you put your best foot forward and convey the quality and value you provide 
							to potential customers. A positive first impression is more likely to yield to a sale than a negative one.
							A great first impression also converts the potential customer to an ambassador even if they do not make an initial purchase.

						<h5 class="text-dark mb-3 text-uppercase">The Delivery Experience Revamp: be outstanding</h5>
						<p>This booster is a must for all product vendors and can be used by service vendors too. This is when the customer 
							gets to experience what they ordered. From first impressions to the order process, this is where your promises 
							are either made or broken. However, you deliver your products or services, your customer needs to know what to 
							expect and when to expect your products. The delivery experience can make or break the order success. 
							It is important for you to be as clear as possible about what happens to unwanted products/services - much 
							better to be upfront than it is to be silent but more than anything, it is important to ensure customer experience 
							remains a positive one.

						<p>You have made a good first impression and secured a sale - great! Now it is time to think about your order process. 
							You need to ensure it is seamless, from when the order is received, ensuring it is tracked until the point when it 
							is fulfilled. 
							Set a gold standard for your business and have a no-hiccup, no-excuses order management process and watch customers 
							praise you for doing what you say.

							Complaints are going to come. No matter how hard you try, but maybe see it as an opportunity to refine your offerings?
